//    If you are finding the result 50, this is because both the threads saw the available tickets are 100 and both of them subtracted 50
//
//        i.e. t1 saw available = 100 and
//
//        available -= 50 =>  50
//
//        also t2 saw available = 100 (because before t1 updates the available count, control switched over to other thread. ) and
//
//        available -= 50 => 50
//
//        Both the threads updated the available count as 50. Hence you saw 50.
//
//        Solution :-
//
//        Though control is passed to other thread because t1 is in the middle of the update operation, we can not allow t2 to proceed with the update i.e. we need to block the threads from simultaneously performing updates over the same object. This can be achieved through synchronized methods/blocks or you can use locks.
//
//        Change the above reserveTickets method and make it synchronized
//
//i.e.
//
//public synchronized void reserveTickets(String trainName, int ticketCount)
//        This will block t2 from performing the operation while t1 is in progress or may be the other way around.
//
//        You can also use the synchronized block or locks for this as well. Obtain the writeLock before proceeding with update.
